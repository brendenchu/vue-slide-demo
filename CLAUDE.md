# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Laravel 12 application with Vue 3 + TypeScript frontend, demonstrating a multi-step slide form system. The application is designed around role-based access control with users (clients, consultants, admins) interacting with "Story" projects through a stepped form interface.

### Domain-Driven Architecture

This application follows **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles with code organized by business domain rather than technical layer. See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for comprehensive architecture documentation.

**Core Business Domains:**

- **Account** - User profiles, teams, subscriptions, terms
- **Story** - Project/story workflow, forms, responses, tokens
- **Admin** - Administrative functions, user management
- **Auth** - Authentication and authorization
- **API** - External API endpoints

**Organization Pattern:**
All major layers (Models, Controllers, Services, Resources, Factories, Enums) follow the same domain-based directory structure. Core entities used across all domains (e.g., `User`, `Role`, `Permission`) remain at the root level, while domain-specific entities are grouped into their respective domain folders.

## Development Commands

### Frontend

- `npm run dev` - Start Vite development server
- `npm run build` - Build frontend assets (includes type checking via `vue-tsc`)
- `npm run type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking without building
- `npm run lint` - Lint JavaScript/TypeScript/Vue files with ESLint
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier

### Backend

- `php artisan test` - Run all tests
- `php artisan test tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php` - Run specific test file
- `php artisan test --filter=testName` - Run filtered tests
- `vendor/bin/pint` - Format PHP code (never use `--test`, always auto-fix)
- `vendor/bin/pint --dirty` - Format only changed files

### Local Development

- Application is served via Laravel Herd at `https://vue-slide-demo.test`
- Use Laravel Boost MCP's `get-absolute-url` tool when generating URLs for users

## Architecture

### Modular Route Organization

Routes are organized into modules in `routes/modules/`:

- `admin.php` - Admin dashboard routes
- `account.php` - User account management
- `story.php` - Core story/project form workflow
- `profile.php` - User profile routes
- `team.php` - Team management routes

All authenticated routes are loaded via `routes/web.php` which includes module files.

### Role-Based System

The application uses Spatie Laravel Permission with predefined roles:

- `client`, `guest` - Access story forms
- `consultant` - Access consultant dashboard
- `admin`, `super-admin` - Access admin dashboard

Roles and permissions are defined as enums in `app/Enums/Role.php` and `app/Enums/Permission.php`. Domain-specific enums are organized by domain (e.g., `app/Enums/Account/TeamStatus.php`, `app/Enums/Story/ProjectStatus.php`).

### Service Layer Pattern

Business logic is encapsulated in services (`app/Services/`):

- `AccountService.php` - User account operations
- `ProjectService.php` - Project/story management
- `TokenService.php` - Authentication token handling

Controllers delegate complex operations to these services rather than containing business logic directly.

### Slide Form System

The core feature is a multi-step slide form implemented as Vue components in `resources/js/Components/Slide/`:

- `SlideProvider.vue` - Main provider component managing slide state, pagination, and navigation
- `Blocks/` - Frame, Content components for slide structure
- `UI/` - Reusable UI elements for the slide system
- `types.d.ts` - TypeScript type definitions for slide system

The slide system uses props `current`, `pages`, `actions`, and `direction` to manage navigation between form steps. Each page is rendered via named slots (`page-1`, `page-2`, etc.).

### Project/Story Workflow

Projects (called "Stories" in the UI) follow a stepped workflow defined by `ProjectStep` and `ProjectStatus` enums (located in `app/Enums/Story/`):

- Users create stories and progress through multiple form steps
- Responses are saved incrementally via `SaveFormController`
- Forms can be continued from where users left off via `ContinueStoryController`
- Final submission happens via `PublishStoryController`
- Project steps and statuses track progress through the workflow

### Frontend Organization

Vue components follow a modular structure:

- `resources/js/Pages/` - Inertia.js page components organized by module (Auth, Account, Admin, Story)
- `resources/js/Components/` - Reusable components (Form inputs, Flash messages, Modal, Slide system)
- `resources/js/Layouts/` - Layout components
- Single entry point: `resources/js/app.ts`

### Styling

- Tailwind CSS v3 with DaisyUI component library
- Custom theme named "demo" configured in `tailwind.config.js`
- Utility plugins: `@tailwindcss/forms`, `@tailwindcss/typography`, `tailwindcss-animate`
- Use `gap` utilities for spacing between items, not margins

### Code Organization by Domain

**Models** (`app/Models/`):

- `User.php` - Core entity at root level
- `Account/` - Profile, Team, Plan, Subscription, Terms
- `Story/` - Project, Response, Token

**Resources** (`app/Http/Resources/`):

- `UserResource.php` - Core resource at root level
- `Account/` - ProfileResource, TeamResource, TermsResource
- `Story/` - ProjectResource, ResponseResource, TokenResource

**Factories** (`database/factories/`):

- `UserFactory.php` - Core factory at root level
- `Account/` - ProfileFactory, TeamFactory, PlanFactory, SubscriptionFactory
- `Story/` - ProjectFactory, ResponseFactory, TokenFactory

**Controllers** (`app/Http/Controllers/`):

- `Controller.php` - Base controller
- `Account/` - Account domain controllers (e.g., `AccountDashboardController`)
- `Admin/` - Admin domain controllers (e.g., `AdminDashboardController`)
- `Story/` - Story domain controllers (e.g., `StoryDashboardController`, `StoryController`)
- `Auth/` - Authentication controllers
- `API/` - API controllers

**Important:** When adding new files, follow the domain-based organization pattern. Place core/shared entities at root level, domain-specific entities in their respective domain folders.

## Testing

- Uses Pest v3 for testing
- Tests are in `tests/Feature/` and `tests/Unit/`
- When creating models in tests, use factories which may have custom states
- Use specific assertion methods like `assertSuccessful()`, `assertForbidden()` instead of generic `assertStatus()`
- Use datasets for testing multiple similar scenarios (especially validation rules)

## Key Dependencies

### Backend

- Laravel 12 with Laravel Sanctum for API authentication
- Spatie Laravel Permission for role/permission management
- Laravel Debugbar (dev only) for debugging
- Ziggy for route generation in JavaScript

### Frontend

- Vue 3 with Composition API and TypeScript
- Inertia.js v2 for SPA routing
- Headless UI and Heroicons for UI components
- DaisyUI for styled components
- class-variance-authority and clsx for conditional styling

## Development Notes

- Never modify past migrations - always create new migrations for schema changes
- Use Form Request classes for validation, not inline controller validation
- Check sibling files for conventions before creating new files (e.g., check other Form Requests for array vs string validation syntax)
- Frontend changes require `npm run build` to reflect in production, or `npm run dev` for development
- The User model has relationships to Account and Team models
- **Domain Organization:** When adding new files, determine which domain they belong to (Account, Story, Admin, Auth, API) and place them in the appropriate domain folder. Only core entities used across all domains should be at root level.
- **Naming Conventions:** Dashboard controllers are prefixed with their domain (e.g., `AccountDashboardController`, `AdminDashboardController`, `StoryDashboardController`) to avoid ambiguity
- **Namespace Imports:** Always use the full domain namespace path (e.g., `App\Enums\Story\ProjectStatus` not `App\Enums\ProjectStatus`)

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to enhance the user's satisfaction building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context

This application is a Laravel application and its main Laravel ecosystems package & versions are below. You are an expert with them all. Ensure you abide by these specific packages & versions.

- php - 8.4.16
- inertiajs/inertia-laravel (INERTIA) - v2
- laravel/framework (LARAVEL) - v12
- laravel/prompts (PROMPTS) - v0
- laravel/sanctum (SANCTUM) - v4
- tightenco/ziggy (ZIGGY) - v2
- laravel/mcp (MCP) - v0
- laravel/pint (PINT) - v1
- laravel/sail (SAIL) - v1
- pestphp/pest (PEST) - v3
- phpunit/phpunit (PHPUNIT) - v11
- @inertiajs/vue3 (INERTIA) - v2
- eslint (ESLINT) - v9
- prettier (PRETTIER) - v3
- tailwindcss (TAILWINDCSS) - v3
- vue (VUE) - v3

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove it works. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure - don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

=== boost rules ===

## Laravel Boost

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan

- Use the `list-artisan-commands` tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double check the available parameters.

## URLs

- Whenever you share a project URL with the user you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain / IP, and port.

## Tinker / Debugging

- You should use the `tinker` tool when you need to execute PHP to debug code or query Eloquent models directly.
- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool

- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)

- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before any other approaches. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation specific for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- The 'search-docs' tool is perfect for all Laravel related packages, including Laravel, Inertia, Livewire, Filament, Tailwind, Pest, Nova, Nightwatch, etc.
- You must use this tool to search for Laravel-ecosystem documentation before falling back to other approaches.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic based queries to start. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`.
- Do not add package names to queries - package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Available Search Syntax

- You can and should pass multiple queries at once. The most relevant results will be returned first.

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit"
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - Words must be adjacent and in that order
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit"
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms

=== php rules ===

## PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even if it has one line.

### Constructors

- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
  - <code-snippet>public function \_\_construct(public GitHub $github) { }</code-snippet>
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters.

### Type Declarations

- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<code-snippet name="Explicit Return Types and Method Params" lang="php">
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
</code-snippet>

## Comments

- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless there is something _very_ complex going on.

## PHPDoc Blocks

- Add useful array shape type definitions for arrays when appropriate.

## Enums

- Typically, keys in an Enum should be TitleCase. For example: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.

=== herd rules ===

## Laravel Herd

- The application is served by Laravel Herd and will be available at: https?://[kebab-case-project-dir].test. Use the `get-absolute-url` tool to generate URLs for the user to ensure valid URLs.
- You must not run any commands to make the site available via HTTP(s). It is _always_ available through Laravel Herd.

=== tests rules ===

## Test Enforcement

- Every change must be programmatically tested. Write a new test or update an existing test, then run the affected tests to make sure they pass.
- Run the minimum number of tests needed to ensure code quality and speed. Use `php artisan test` with a specific filename or filter.

=== inertia-laravel/core rules ===

## Inertia Core

- Inertia.js components should be placed in the `resources/js/Pages` directory unless specified differently in the JS bundler (vite.config.js).
- Use `Inertia::render()` for server-side routing instead of traditional Blade views.
- Use `search-docs` for accurate guidance on all things Inertia.

<code-snippet lang="php" name="Inertia::render Example">
// routes/web.php example
Route::get('/users', function () {
    return Inertia::render('Users/Index', [
        'users' => User::all()
    ]);
});
</code-snippet>

=== inertia-laravel/v2 rules ===

## Inertia v2

- Make use of all Inertia features from v1 & v2. Check the documentation before making any changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.

### Inertia v2 New Features

- Polling
- Prefetching
- Deferred props
- Infinite scrolling using merging props and `WhenVisible`
- Lazy loading data on scroll

### Deferred Props & Empty States

- When using deferred props on the frontend, you should add a nice empty state with pulsing / animated skeleton.

### Inertia Form General Guidance

- Build forms using the `useForm` helper. Use the code examples and `search-docs` tool with a query of `useForm helper` for guidance.

=== laravel/core rules ===

## Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using the `list-artisan-commands` tool.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Database

- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `list-artisan-commands` to check the available options to `php artisan make:model`.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

### Controllers & Validation

- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

### Queues

- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

### Authentication & Authorization

- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

### URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

### Configuration

- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

### Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

### Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== laravel/v12 rules ===

## Laravel 12

- Use the `search-docs` tool to get version specific documentation.
- Since Laravel 11, Laravel has a new streamlined file structure which this project uses.

### Laravel 12 Structure

- No middleware files in `app/Http/Middleware/`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- **No app\Console\Kernel.php** - use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- **Commands auto-register** - files in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

### Database

- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 11 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models

- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.

=== pint/core rules ===

## Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- You must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest

### Testing

- If you need to verify a feature is working, write or update a Unit / Feature test.

### Pest Tests

- All tests must be written using Pest. Use `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- You must not remove any tests or test files from the tests directory without approval. These are not temporary or helper files - these are core to the application.
- Tests should test all of the happy paths, failure paths, and weird paths.
- Tests live in the `tests/Feature` and `tests/Unit` directories.
- Pest tests look and behave like this:
  <code-snippet name="Basic Pest Test Example" lang="php">
  it('is true', function () {
  expect(true)->toBeTrue();
  });
  </code-snippet>

### Running Tests

- Run the minimal number of tests using an appropriate filter before finalizing code edits.
- To run all tests: `php artisan test`.
- To run all tests in a file: `php artisan test tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`.
- To filter on a particular test name: `php artisan test --filter=testName` (recommended after making a change to a related file).
- When the tests relating to your changes are passing, ask the user if they would like to run the entire test suite to ensure everything is still passing.

### Pest Assertions

- When asserting status codes on a response, use the specific method like `assertForbidden` and `assertNotFound` instead of using `assertStatus(403)` or similar, e.g.:
  <code-snippet name="Pest Example Asserting postJson Response" lang="php">
  it('returns all', function () {
  $response = $this->postJson('/api/docs', []);

      $response->assertSuccessful();

  });
  </code-snippet>

### Mocking

- Mocking can be very helpful when appropriate.
- When mocking, you can use the `Pest\Laravel\mock` Pest function, but always import it via `use function Pest\Laravel\mock;` before using it. Alternatively, you can use `$this->mock()` if existing tests do.
- You can also create partial mocks using the same import or self method.

### Datasets

- Use datasets in Pest to simplify tests which have a lot of duplicated data. This is often the case when testing validation rules, so consider going with this solution when writing tests for validation rules.

<code-snippet name="Pest Dataset Example" lang="php">
it('has emails', function (string $email) {
    expect($email)->not->toBeEmpty();
})->with([
    'james' => 'james@laravel.com',
    'taylor' => 'taylor@laravel.com',
]);
</code-snippet>

=== inertia-vue/core rules ===

## Inertia + Vue

- Vue components must have a single root element.
- Use `router.visit()` or `<Link>` for navigation instead of traditional links.

<code-snippet name="Inertia Client Navigation" lang="vue">

    import { Link } from '@inertiajs/vue3'
    <Link href="/">Home</Link>

</code-snippet>

=== inertia-vue/v2/forms rules ===

## Inertia + Vue Forms

<code-snippet name="Inertia Vue useForm example" lang="vue">

<script setup>
    import { useForm } from '@inertiajs/vue3'

    const form = useForm({
        email: null,
        password: null,
        remember: false,
    })
</script>

<template>
    <form @submit.prevent="form.post('/login')">
        <!-- email -->
        <input type="text" v-model="form.email">
        <div v-if="form.errors.email">{{ form.errors.email }}</div>
        <!-- password -->
        <input type="password" v-model="form.password">
        <div v-if="form.errors.password">{{ form.errors.password }}</div>
        <!-- remember me -->
        <input type="checkbox" v-model="form.remember"> Remember Me
        <!-- submit -->
        <button type="submit" :disabled="form.processing">Login</button>
    </form>
</template>

</code-snippet>

=== tailwindcss/core rules ===

## Tailwind Core

- Use Tailwind CSS classes to style HTML, check and use existing tailwind conventions within the project before writing your own.
- Offer to extract repeated patterns into components that match the project's conventions (i.e. Blade, JSX, Vue, etc..)
- Think through class placement, order, priority, and defaults - remove redundant classes, add classes to parent or child carefully to limit repetition, group elements logically
- You can use the `search-docs` tool to get exact examples from the official documentation when needed.

### Spacing

- When listing items, use gap utilities for spacing, don't use margins.

    <code-snippet name="Valid Flex Gap Spacing Example" lang="html">
        <div class="flex gap-8">
            <div>Superior</div>
            <div>Michigan</div>
            <div>Erie</div>
        </div>
    </code-snippet>

### Dark Mode

- If existing pages and components support dark mode, new pages and components must support dark mode in a similar way, typically using `dark:`.

=== tailwindcss/v3 rules ===

## Tailwind 3

- Always use Tailwind CSS v3 - verify you're using only classes supported by this version.
  </laravel-boost-guidelines>
